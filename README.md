> High performance critical css extraction library with a multiple url support.
> crittr enables you to extract the critical path stylesheet rules of a single or multiple urls with lightning speed. Multiple urls are the unique selling point of this library due to the fact that nearly every website using one css file for multiple sub pages. Now you are able to gather the critical css of all pages in one extracting process. And this blazing fast even with rich internet applications! :muscle:

#### Feature Facts

- Amazing speed
- Designed to be used by power users as a nodejs module (no useless browser usage)
- :boom: **Only library which is able to extract summarized critical css from multiple urls which has a common use case -> Most of the websites using one css file for multiple subpages** :boom: :metal:
- When using multiple urls a max concurrency of extraction is adjustable. For machines with less power
- Ongoing maintenance because of being used in enterprise environment
- Returns not only the critical css. Also returns the remaining css of your given file. You don't need to include the full css on your page or reduce the css on your own :heart:

## Performance

If you use many urls to check against a single css file it will slow down the process. Anyway this is the scenario where crittr can shine. The only thing you need to take care of is the power of the machine you're running crittr on.

## Comparison

There are some other libraries out there dealing with the topic of extracting the critical css. Crittr has it's own approach of dealing with this topic. Many features allow users to forget about using any other libraries because crittr already deal with the most things which are important for extracting critical css.

![Comparison](/docs/img/comp_table.png)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- minimum nodejs > 7.6 | recommended nodejs 8+
  - async/await
  - Promises
- puppeteer dependecies on UNIX bases OS (including MacOSX)

> Due to some dependencies of crittr you may need to install some additional software.
> Puppeteer has some special requirements if you are running on an UNIX based operation system. You can read more about this fact here. Including a list of what to install: [Puppeteer Troubleshooting](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#chrome-headless-doesnt-launch)

### Installation

To use crittr as a module or cli in your nodejs environment just install it with

```
npm i crittr
```

### Usage

#### Modul usage

To use crittr as a module just require it and choose your [options](#options).

The crittr module has the expects an object as input parameter and returns an array with 2 css strings. The first one is the criticalCss string and the second one is the remaining css without the critical selectors.

```javascript
// async/await
(async () => {
  const { critical, rest } = await crittr(options);
})();

// Promise
crittr(options).then(({ critical, rest }) => {
  // handle css
});
```

##### Basic

```javascript
const Crittr = require("crittr");

Crittr({
  urls: ["https://github.com/"],
  css: `.header-logo-invertocat {
            margin: -1px 15px -1px -2px;
            color: #fff;
            white-space: nowrap;
        }`,
  device: {
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
  },
})
  .then(({ critical, rest }) => {
    console.log(critical);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

As you can also read in the [options](#options) section there is the possibility to use a css file as a path instead of a string. If the path provided ends with `.css` it is treated as a file path.

```javascript
const Crittr = require("crittr");

Crittr({
  urls: ["https://github.com/"],
  css: "./test/data/test.css",
}).then(({ critical, rest }) => {
  console.log(critical);
});
```

Due to the fact, that crittr is returning a **Promise<String>** you can also use async/await syntax to handle the result.

```javascript
(async () => {
  const Crittr = require("crittr");
  try {
    const { critical, rest } = await Crittr({
      urls: ["https://github.com/"],
      css: "./test/data/test.css",
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

##### Basic - Whithout css

You can skip adding CSS. Crittr will collect all styles (external and inline) from the first url in your list as base CSS.
```javascript
Crittr({
    urls:   [
        "https://github.com"
    ],
    device: {
        width:  1920,
        height: 1080
    }
}).then( ({critical, rest}) => {
    console.log(critical);
}).catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
});

```

##### Advanced - Multiple urls

To use the full power of crittr and get the most of the performance advantage you should pass in multiple urls. As of the fact that the most websites use one css file for multiple pages this is the ultimate way to get the critical css for all of them!

```javascript
const Crittr = require("crittr");

const urls = [
  "https://example.com/page1",
  "https://example.com/page2",
  "https://example.com/about",
  "https://example.com/shop",
];

Crittr({
  urls: urls,
  css: "./example.com/css/main.css",
}).then(({ critical, rest }) => {
  // criticalCss contains all the above the fold css
  // restCss is the rest remaining after excluding the criticalCss.
  // You can start including it directly as a defered css without
  // any need to calculate it on your own
  console.log(critical);
});
```

You can see the output of the time measurement after every run. So you will be able to check you overall processing time.

```
▶  Crittr Run Initialized timer...
◼  Crittr Run Timer run for: 2.33s
```

#### CLI Usage

The CLI usage is not implemented yet :scream:. At the moment there is no need of cli usage, but if you need it just open an issue and I will try to get it done! :heart:

## Wildcards

You are already able to define the selectors to force keep or remove. With wildcards you can define a range of selectors to match against one entry in force selectors. The wildcard symbol is the `%` character. It can put at the beginning or end of a string. Take care of whitespaces between the selector string and the `%` as it will count as a character. Let's have a quick example:

```javascript
const { critical, rest } = await Crittr({
  urls: urls,
  css: css,
  keepSelectors: [".test %"],
});
```

This keepSelectors options will match every selector that begins with `.test` and has no further selectors attached. Means `.test.test2`wouldn't match because there is a whitespace in there. But it will match `.test .test2 .test3`. Also this example wouldn't match selectors like this:

```css
.pre .test .test2 {
} /* no match */
.pre.test .test2 {
} /* no match */
.test .test2 {
} /* match */
.test.test2 {
} /* no match */
.test .test2:before {
} /* match */
```

## FAQ :confused:

- Why do I need to put my css file in when I only want to extract the critical css?
  You don't need to but if you don't set your css file as an option you may not receive all vendor prefixes you may expect. This is due testing with only one browser engine which drop other prefixes. Otherwise - it's 2021, who needs vendor prefixes?
- After including the remaining css aswell my page starts looking different. Why is that?
  If you progress more than 1 url at the same time crittr can not determinate where a rule has to be positioned in the whole css to not get in conflict with other rules overwriting them. You have to write clean css to prevent such an behaviour. Overwriting rules should always have longer selectors than the rules they are overwriting to raise priority.

## Known Bugs :shit:

None yet

## Troubleshooting

#### WSL / Windows Linux Subsystem Support

Some unkown reasons prevent puppeteer to run properly in a WSL environment. If you have any errors please try to use your default OS command shell or equivalent. If the error still exists don't hesitate to create an issue ticket.
